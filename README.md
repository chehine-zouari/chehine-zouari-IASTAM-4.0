**SmartLink: A Scalable Digital Twin Platform for Predictive Facility Management**

**Overview:**
SmartLink is a comprehensive platform that integrates real-time sensor data into Building Collaboration Format (BCF) digital twins. The platform offers advanced features for facility management, including real-time data visualization, predictive maintenance, and scenario simulation, with seamless interoperability with existing BIM tools.

**Repository Structure:**
This repository contains the following key components:

**1. Digital Twin Dashboard**
A dashboard built using Dash and Plotly for real-time visualization of sensor data. This dashboard allows facility managers to interact with the digital twin, simulate potential changes, and view the predicted impact on facility metrics.

Features:
- Real-time sensor data visualization.
- Scenario simulation and impact analysis.
- Interactive controls for adjusting temperature and viewing outcomes.

**2. Edge Processing Nodes: Detecting Anomalies in Temperature Readings**
This module uses edge computing to preprocess sensor data before sending it to the central system. The goal is to reduce latency and detect anomalies in real-time, ensuring the system only processes relevant data.

Features:
- Anomaly detection in temperature data.
- Real-time sensor data preprocessing at the source.

**3. Machine Learning Model Development**
The machine learning module trains models using historical and real-time data to predict potential maintenance issues, inefficiencies, or equipment failures.

Features:
- Predictive models for maintenance forecasting.
- Identification of patterns that indicate wear and inefficiency.

**4. Predictive Maintenance Modeling**
The PredictPro Analytics module uses integrated sensor data to forecast potential maintenance needs. It applies machine learning to historical and real-time data, enabling facility managers to proactively manage equipment and prevent costly failures.

Features:
- Predictive maintenance alerts.
- Machine learning-based maintenance forecasting.

**5. RealSync Engine: Real-Time Data Processing System**
The RealSync Engine ensures that sensor data is continuously updated in the digital twin. Leveraging cloud computing, it handles large volumes of data while providing near-instantaneous updates.

Features:
- Scalable cloud-based data processing.
- Continuous real-time updates.

**How to Use:**
- Digital Twin Dashboard: Interact with real-time sensor data and run scenario simulations.
- Edge Processing Nodes: Detect and respond to anomalies in sensor data.
- PredictPro Analytics: View predictive maintenance insights and forecasts.
- RealSync Engine: Experience real-time updates of digital twin data.

**Future Development Plans:**
1. Enhanced AI Capabilities: Improving machine learning models for better predictive accuracy.
2. Blockchain Security: Incorporating blockchain technology to secure data exchange and ensure integrity.
